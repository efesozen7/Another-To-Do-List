# Another-To-Do-List
Created a one page to-do list website to practice JavaScript. This project was created by Efe Sozen (me) for the purpose of practicing the new concepts I learned about JavaScript-HTML-CSS. The project is a simple to-do list website and consists of features, such as reading input, adding/deleting items from the to-do list, marking items as completed, counting how many items were completed and finally printing an indicator showing whether or not the user has completed 5 goals.
